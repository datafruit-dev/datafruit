### 1. Install Datafruit

```bash
pip install datafruit
```

### 2. Define Your Data Models

In your Python code, import Datafruit and SQLModel. Declare models as classes:

```python
import datafruit as dft
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field

class User(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int = Field(primary_key=True)
    name: str
    email: str = Field(unique=True)
    active: bool = True

class Post(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: int = Field(primary_key=True)
    title: str
    body: str
    published: bool = False

# Create a database instance
url = os.getenv("POSTGRES_URL")
db = dft.postgres_db(url, [User, Post])
```

### 3. Inspect Schema Changes

Use the `plan` command to see pending migrations:

```bash
dft plan
```

This prints a diff of tables/columns to be added, removed, or modified.

### 4. Apply Migrations

When youâ€™re ready, apply changes to your database:

```bash
dft apply
```

Under the hood, Datafruit generates and runs Alembic migration scripts for you.

You now have a working Datafruit setup: define models in code, preview changes, and apply migrations seamlessly. For more details, see the full documentation.
